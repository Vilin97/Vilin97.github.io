## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington.

## Research Interests

- **Interacting particle systems:** solve Fokker-Planck-type equations using neural networks.
- **Math formalization:** use Lean to formalize mathematics.
- **Machine learning:** use machine learning to solve practical problems.
